React Native App
=====================

Getting Start

First install Homebrew using the instructions on the Homebrew website, then install Node.js by executing the following in a Terminal window:

```bash
brew install node
```

Next, use homebrew to install watchman, a file watcher from Facebook:

```bash
brew install watchman
```

Next use npm to install the React Native Command Line Interface (CLI) tool:

```bash
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

Navigate to the folder where you would like to develop your React Native application, and use the CLI tool to construct the project:

```bash
react-native init PropertyFinder
```
